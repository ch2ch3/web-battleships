Web Battleships
===============

![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/gypsydave5/web-battleships.svg?branch=master)

As if it wasn't enough to write [Battleships for the
terminal](https://github.com/gypsydave5/battleships), **YARR!spec**
([Ethel](https://github.com/ch2ch3), [Andy](https://github.com/andy010),
[Spike](https://github.com/spike01), and [Dave](https://github.com/gypsydave5))
now attempt to do the same with a web interface, utilizing the
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) framework, a sou√ßon of
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and a whole lot of luck.

It remains, of course, a hit...
